About the Examples

The PNGwriter distribution includes two simple examples to get you started:

* pngtest.cc
* lyapunov.cc

pngtest.cc, when compiled and run, will generate some PNG files. The source is fully commented, and should give you the confidence to begin writing programs with PNGwriter in no time. 

lyapunov.cc calculates a two-dimensional plot of the lyapunov exponent for the logistic equation where the coefficient R, usually a constant, is replaced by a finite sequence of two values, A and B. Put simply, it makes really pretty pictures. If it is run with '999' as the command-line argument (./lyapunov 999), it will print out instructions for use. 

The pngwriter.h header file is fully commented as well, and should you lose the PNGwriter Quick Reference, or be without internet access to check the website, it will serve as a reference manual.

The Makefile is also fully commented.
