Update on our last comment:
Since the policy change on SourceForge.net the adware issue on downloads for
unmaintained software was changed (about a year ago by now).

Great to hear!
(Still, we continue to stay on GitHub for now.)

## New version and a new team member â€” August 2015 Update

A long time has passed since PNGwriter's last release. Thanks to the skilled
and generous help of Axel Huebl ([@ax3l](http://github.com/ax3l)) many bugs
have been fixed, a new compilation procedure is in place, and PNGwriter is now
on [GitHub](https://github.com/pngwriter/pngwriter). Axel is now an active and
invaluable member of the PNGwriter Team, joining Paul Blackburn
([@individual61](https://github.com/individual61)), who created PNGwriter in
2002. Welcome aboard, Axel!

This nudge to action could not have come at a better time, since the
once-respectable host to the PNGwriter project, SourceForge.net, is no longer
what we consider a positive contribution to the Open Source community.
The PNGwriter website and files currently hosted on SourceForge.net will remain
on SourceForge.net, but the current and all future releases will be via
PNGwriter's GitHub repository.
 **Don't forget**!

Thank you, PNGwriter users, for your patience, bug fixes, and suggestions. I
hope you are as excited as we are to see where the next thirteen years take
PNGwriter!
